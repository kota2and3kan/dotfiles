# Claude Code Global Rules

## Common Rules

- Use **English** for documentation, code comments, and other files you generate in a project.
- Use **Japanese** for responses in the prompt. Use **Japanese** in the conversation with the user, even though the user uses other languages.

## Programming Rules

- If anything is unclear in the requirements, specification, tasks, and so on, please ask the user. Don't start any processes of code generation if there is unclear stuff.
